# Bookmarkit design

Bookmarkit is a client-first bookmark manager delivered as a Vite/React web
build and a Chrome Manifest V3 extension. This document records the boundaries
that are costly to rediscover from individual files; component-level behavior
belongs beside the code and user-facing behavior belongs in `README.md`.

## Surfaces and build

Vite builds two HTML entry points from the repository root:

| Surface               | Entry        | React root                        |
| --------------------- | ------------ | --------------------------------- |
| Full bookmark manager | `index.html` | `src/main.jsx` → `BookmarkApp`    |
| Toolbar quick add     | `popup.html` | `src/popup/main.jsx` → `QuickAdd` |

`scripts/build-chrome.js` runs after the Vite build and copies only extension
metadata, the background worker, icons, and legal notices into `dist/`. It must
not overwrite `dist/popup.html`, because that file contains Vite's generated
asset references. There is no content script and Bookmarkit injects nothing
into visited pages.

The default local store depends on Chrome extension APIs. The standalone web
build is therefore a Firebase deployment target rather than a localStorage-only
edition.

## Application and state flow

`src/components/BookmarkApp.jsx` owns the full-app orchestration: the active
store, LLM plan, manual filters, keyboard behavior, themes, selection, and
modal visibility. `src/popup/QuickAdd.jsx` is a separate small surface, but it
uses the same store hook and theme hook so bookmark writes do not fork.

The visible list is a projection, never a second source of truth:

```text
store bookmarks
  → applyAgentPlan(lastAction)
  → applyManualFilters(effectiveFilters)
  → displayedBookmarks
```

Manual sorting runs last and intentionally overrides an agent sort. Clearing
manual filters does not clear the agent plan, and clearing agent search does
not clear manual filters.

## Persistence boundary

`src/stores/index.js` selects one of three implementations behind the shared
bookmark-store contract:

| Store                     | Responsibility                                                                                                                                             |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `localCompositeStore.js`  | Default extension store: Chrome bookmarks own title and URL; `localStorage` entries prefixed `bm_meta:` own tags, rating, description, and other metadata. |
| `chromeBookmarksStore.js` | Direct Chrome Bookmarks API adapter without metadata persistence.                                                                                          |
| `firebaseStore.js`        | Optional Firestore store under `artifacts/<appId>/users/<uid>/bookmarks`.                                                                                  |

Every implementation supports initialization, listing/subscription, single and
bulk writes, deletion, and order persistence. New UI paths should depend on
that behavior through `useBookmarkStore`, not detect or call a backend directly.

## LLM boundary

Provider adapters in `src/llm/providers/` expose `generate(prompt)` through the
factory in `src/llm/index.js`. The app asks a provider for structured action
steps, parses them, and applies the resulting plan to the in-memory bookmark
list. Provider failure falls back to ordinary bookmark search; persistence is
still performed only by a store operation initiated by application behavior.

Runtime provider settings override build-time defaults and remain in browser
storage. They are user configuration, not repository configuration, and must
never be committed.

## Trust and privacy boundaries

- Local-mode bookmark content stays in Chrome bookmarks plus the extension's
  local metadata. Firebase mode stores it in the configured Firebase project.
- LLM prompts leave the browser only for the provider the user selected. API
  keys are stored in browser local storage and are never build inputs in the
  default release.
- URL reachability checks execute in `public/background.js`, not page context.
  They accept only public HTTP(S) destinations and do not follow redirects, so
  the extension's broad host permission does not become an internal-network
  request primitive.
- The release archive includes `LICENSE` and generated
  `THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md`. The latter is derived from the locked production
  dependency closure and checked for drift in CI.

## Release model

Changesets describe user-visible changes. The version-cut workflow maintains a
reviewable version PR, synchronizes the npm and extension-manifest versions,
and creates the immutable tag after that PR merges. The release workflow
revalidates the tagged tree, builds the Chrome extension, and publishes the zip
and checksum. Manual version edits, tags, or uploads bypass those consistency
checks and are unsupported.
