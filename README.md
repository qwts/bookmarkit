# bookmarkit

**Bookmarkit** is a modern, React‑powered application that helps you organize and query your bookmarks using natural language. It can be used both as a **Vite/React web app** and packaged as a **Chrome extension**.

Key capabilities include:

- Natural-language search and AI-driven actions
- Multi-provider LLM integration (Gemini, OpenAI, Grok, Ollama, LM Studio)
- Import/export to JSON or Netscape HTML
- Local or optional Firebase storage backend

The project is built with Vite, styled with Tailwind CSS, and designed for flexibility through runtime configuration and modular architecture.

---

## Features

- Natural language search (AI agent)
  - Examples: “find github”, “find tags: react then sort by rating descending”, “show 3 stars or more”, “remove duplicates”
  - Persist sorted order across all bookmarks (e.g., “reorder descending by title”)
- Import/Export
  - JSON array of bookmarks
  - Netscape Bookmark HTML (compatible with browsers’ export files)
- Bookmark management
  - Add, edit, delete, tag, folder, rating, favicon support
  - Multi‑select (Cmd/Ctrl+Click), open in new tab (Shift+Click)
  - Detect and remove duplicates (by title + URL)
- URL status
  - Lightweight validity check via HEAD request from the extension service worker
  - One‑click “Ignore checking” toggle per bookmark
- LLM integration (runtime‑configurable)
  - Gemini, OpenAI (ChatGPT), Grok (x.ai), Ollama (local), LM Studio (local)
  - Model discovery (where supported), custom base URLs, stored per provider
- Storage backends
  - Local (browser) by default
  - Optional Firebase (Cloud Firestore) backend
- Keyboard shortcuts
  - Click selects; Cmd/Ctrl+Click multi‑selects; Shift+Click opens
  - Double‑click or E to edit
  - Esc clears selection
  - Cmd/Ctrl+A select all, Cmd/Ctrl+D delete selected
  - D deletes (with confirmation), Space opens selected

## Demo (quick tour)

- Top search bar: type natural language queries and hit Enter.
- Options: type “options” in the search bar to open provider settings.
- Import/Export: button in the header for JSON/HTML.
- Remove Duplicates: button in the header or type “remove duplicates”.

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js — version pinned in `.nvmrc` (`nvm use`)
- npm
- Google Chrome (for the extension)
- Optional:
  - API keys for LLMs (Gemini/OpenAI/Grok), or
  - Local LLM runtime (Ollama or LM Studio)

### Install a release (recommended — no build required)

1. Download `bookmarkit-v<version>.zip` from the **[latest release](https://github.com/qwts/bookmarkit/releases/latest)**.
2. Optionally verify it against the published checksum:
   ```bash
   shasum -a 256 -c bookmarkit-v<version>.zip.sha256
   ```
3. Unzip it.
4. Open `chrome://extensions`, enable **Developer mode**, click **Load unpacked**, and select the
   unzipped folder.
5. Pin the toolbar icon. Clicking it opens quick-add for the current tab; "Open full app" in the
   popup opens the full bookmark manager.

Want a build of an unreleased branch? Every CI run attaches the same zip as a `bookmarkit-extension`
artifact — open the run from the
[Actions tab](https://github.com/qwts/bookmarkit/actions/workflows/ci.yml) and download it from the
run summary.

### Build from source

Node is pinned in `.nvmrc` (`nvm use` picks it up).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/qwts/bookmarkit.git
cd bookmarkit
npm install
npm run build:chrome   # -> dist/, load that folder as unpacked
```

> **`npm run dev` is not a dev server.** It runs `vite build --mode development` — a sourcemapped,
> unminified build into `dist/`. There is no HMR: re-run it after each change and reload the
> extension from `chrome://extensions`. `npm run preview` serves `dist/` over HTTP, but the default
> storage backend needs the `chrome.bookmarks` API, so the app only really works when loaded as an
> extension (or built with `__use_firebase__`).

## Chrome extension

Load either the released zip or your own `dist/` build (see **Install** above) via
`chrome://extensions` -> Developer mode -> Load unpacked.

The extension ships two surfaces from one build:

| Surface       | Entry        | What it is                                                                                                                                  |
| ------------- | ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Toolbar popup | `popup.html` | Quick-add for the current tab: prefilled title/URL, tags, rating, folder. Detects an already-saved URL and edits it instead of duplicating. |
| Full app      | `index.html` | The complete manager (search, agent, import/export, options). Opened from the popup's "Open full app".                                      |

Permissions requested (`public/manifest.json`):

- `bookmarks` — the default store keeps title/URL in the real Chrome bookmark tree.
- `storage` — settings, themes, and the per-bookmark metadata layer.
- `<all_urls>` — lets the background service worker run URL reachability checks from a privileged
  context (bypassing page CORS), and lets the popup read the active tab's title/URL. Requests are
  restricted to public http(s) hosts; private, loopback, and link-local addresses are blocked, and
  redirects are not followed.

## Configure AI providers

You can configure everything at runtime in the Options dialog (type “options” in the search bar). Settings persist per browser in localStorage.

Supported providers:

- Gemini
- OpenAI (ChatGPT)
- Grok (x.ai)
- Ollama (local)
- LM Studio (local)

Options per provider:

- API key (remote providers)
- Base URL (OpenAI/Grok optional; Ollama/LM Studio required, e.g., http://localhost:11434 or http://localhost:1234)
- Model: auto‑discovery where supported, or type manually

Local providers:

- Ollama: install and run, pull a model (e.g., llama3.1), set base URL: http://localhost:11434
- LM Studio: run the local server, set base URL (default is often http://localhost:1234)

Tip: If an LLM call fails or returns invalid output, the app gracefully falls back to a general search.

## Optional: Build‑time defaults

You can set global defaults with Vite’s define. This is optional; the in‑app Options are usually enough.

vite.config.(js|ts) example:

```js
import { defineConfig } from "vite";
import react from "@vitejs/plugin-react";

// You can also read from process.env or .env files (VITE_* vars)
export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [react()],
  define: {
    __llm_provider__: JSON.stringify("gemini"),
    __llm_options__: JSON.stringify({
      // apiKey: process.env.VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY,
      // model: 'gemini-2.0-flash'
    }),
    __use_firebase__: JSON.stringify(false),
    __firebase_config: JSON.stringify(undefined),
    __app_id: JSON.stringify("bookmarkit"),
    __initial_auth_token: JSON.stringify(undefined),
  },
});
```

If you set **use_firebase** to true, also provide a valid __firebase_config (see Firebase section).

## Firebase (optional)

The app can use Firebase (Cloud Firestore) instead of local storage.

Steps:

1. Create a Firebase project and enable Firestore
2. Grab your web app config:
   - apiKey, authDomain, projectId, etc.
3. Provide it at build time:
   - Set **use_firebase**: true
   - Set __firebase_config: the JSON stringified Firebase config
4. Rebuild and run

Auth:

- The code exposes an optional __initial_auth_token if you want to inject an auth token at boot.
- If you don’t provide auth, your store module may default to anonymous or local. See your store implementation for details.

Data model:

- Bookmarks are stored with timestamps (createdAt/updatedAt)
- Reorder and live updates are supported via store methods

## Import/Export

- JSON
  - Exports an array of bookmark objects
  - Import expects the same: an array

Bookmark JSON shape (id is optional on import):

```json
[
  {
    "id": "optional",
    "title": "Example",
    "url": "https://example.com",
    "description": "Short description",
    "tags": ["reference", "web"],
    "rating": 4,
    "folderId": "work",
    "faviconUrl": "https://example.com/favicon.ico",
    "createdAt": "2024-01-01T12:00:00.000Z",
    "updatedAt": "2024-01-01T12:00:00.000Z",
    "urlStatus": "valid"
  }
]
```

- HTML (Netscape Bookmark File)
  - Compatible with exports from Chrome/Firefox/etc.
  - You can upload the file or paste its contents
  - Export creates a standard bookmark HTML with fields like ADD_DATE, LAST_MODIFIED, ICON, DESCRIPTION

## Natural language commands (examples)

- find github
- find tags: react then sort by rating descending
- filter rating >= 4 then sort by title asc
- show 3 stars or more
- remove duplicates
- show all
- reorder ascending by title
- limit first 10
- options (opens Options dialog)
- import or export (opens Import/Export)

The agent plans actions (search, filter, sort, limit, persist reorder) and updates the view accordingly.

## Keyboard shortcuts

- Click: select a bookmark
- Cmd/Ctrl+Click: toggle multi‑select
- Shift+Click: open in new tab
- Double‑click or E: edit selected
- Esc: clear selection
- Cmd/Ctrl+A: select all visible
- Cmd/Ctrl+D or D: delete selected (with confirmation)
- Space (on focused tile): select/open depending on context

## URL validation

- The extension checks URLs with a HEAD request issued from the background service worker, which
  runs in a privileged context and so bypasses page CORS. No third-party proxy is involved — the
  URL is sent only to the site itself.
- Only public http(s) hosts are checked. Private, loopback, link-local, and cloud-metadata
  addresses are refused, and redirects are not followed (both are SSRF guards).
- If a site is blocked or unreachable, status may show “invalid”.
- You can toggle “Ignore checking” per bookmark.

## Privacy and storage

- Local mode: data stays in your browser (local storage/IndexedDB per store implementation)
- Firebase mode: data is stored in your Firebase project
- API keys you enter in Options are saved to localStorage in your browser
- LLM calls are made from your browser to providers you select

## Troubleshooting

- LLM errors/failures:
  - Ensure API key and base URL (if applicable) are set in Options
  - Try the “Refresh” button next to Model
  - Use a smaller model or local provider for testing
- Extension shows blank page:
  - Confirm manifest.json exists in dist
  - Load unpacked pointing to the dist folder after a build
  - Check Chrome console for CSP/network issues and adjust host_permissions
- URL check always invalid:
  - Some sites block HEAD requests; toggle “Ignore checking”

## Scripts

| Script                    | What it does                                                         |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `npm run dev`             | Sourcemapped, unminified build to `dist/`. **Not** a dev server.     |
| `npm run build`           | Production build to `dist/`.                                         |
| `npm run build:chrome`    | Production build + copies the extension files into `dist/`.          |
| `npm run preview`         | Serves `dist/` over HTTP (see the caveat under Build from source).   |
| `npm run lint`            | ESLint.                                                              |
| `npm test`                | Vitest suite once (`npm run test:watch` to watch).                   |
| `npm run ci`              | The full gate CI runs: version policy, lint, tests, extension build. |
| `npm run changeset`       | Record a changeset describing a user-facing change.                  |
| `npm run package:release` | Build and package `release/bookmarkit-v<version>.zip` + checksum.    |

## Releasing

Releases are automated; nobody tags or uploads by hand.

1. A PR with a user-facing change adds a changeset (`npm run changeset`).
2. When it merges, **Version cut** opens or refreshes a rolling
   `chore: version bookmarkit` PR that applies the pending changesets and bumps
   `package.json`, `public/manifest.json`, and `package-lock.json` together.
3. Merging _that_ PR is the release action: it tags `v<version>` and triggers **Release**, which
   re-runs the full gate against the tag and publishes the zip + `.sha256` to a GitHub Release.

`npm run check:version-policy` enforces that the three version artifacts never drift apart — a
manifest that disagrees with `package.json` would ship a build that lies about its own version.
